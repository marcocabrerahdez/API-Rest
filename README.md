In this API, we will make use of different tools with the ultimate goal of having a simple and functional program that allows us to perform creation, reading, modification and deletion operations (the famous CRUD operations) on songs, artists and playlists.

A simple bet, with a series of challenges, which will reward us with the possibility of easily managing our own digital music library.

It is an honor to present MusicTronik360, our proposal, created for the user and inspired by our first music digitization project, Musitronic360.
